# Palindrome Checker
A program that checks if a given string has the same characters in the same order when the string is reversed.

I was asked to create this without performing any internet searches. I know there are multiple places where I could have improved it easily, but I either didn't know how off the top of my head or I couldn't remember where to find the necessary classes and methods.

I'm sure there's something fancy in LINQ that could do it in a single line or two.
